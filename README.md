# dotfiles

My environment workflow for coding includes using a Linux operating system. In the "themes" folder, I keep the theme I currently use on Linux, which I enjoy. In the ".config" folder, there are "nvim" and "kitty" folders. The "nvim" folder contains my configuration for the nvim text editor, and the "kitty" folder contains my configuration for the kitty terminal I use.

In the "dotfiles" folder, there are a ".tmux" folder and "tmux.conf" file, which are used for configuring the tmux terminal multiplexer to enhance my terminal experience.

In summary, this is my workflow and setup for programming, which includes customizing various tools such as the text editor, terminal, and terminal multiplexer to improve my productivity and experience.
